# Music-Gallery-Early-Acces
This is a Music Gallery made for fun in HTML5 and CSS (i only used it to change the color of the letters).
The gallery only has some SM64 themes (if you don't know what SM64 means, it means Super Mario 64.
To open it just click two times on index.HTML.
You Need to download the mp3 files to let the web work (if there's a different way to let the web work
without downloading the mp3 files please tell me).
(I don't know who drew this but it wasn't me).
(You need  to download the README.md in order to see it, or that's what i think).
