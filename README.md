# Music-Gallery-Early-Acces
This is a Music Gallery made for fun in HTML5 and CSS (i only used it to change the color of the letters).
To open it just click two times on index (the one with a browser icon).
You Need to download the mp3 files to let the web work (if there's a different way to let the web work
without downloading the mp3 files please tell me).
(I don't know who drew this but it wasn't me).
(You need  to download the README.md in order to see it, or that's what i think).
